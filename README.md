# apostrophe-sections

## DEPRECATED

This module is deprecated for new projects and is not compatible with A2 0.5. We recommend [apostrophe-blocks](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-blocks) or [apostrophe-schema-widgets](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe-schema-widgets), depending on your needs. If you need to build navigation from blocks or schema widgets you can do so using browser-side javascript, and these techniques are much more flexible.

## Overview

Support for pages that are split into multiple sections, accessible via scrolling but also via tabs. There is support for adding, removing, reordering and re-titling sections conveniently. Entire sections may be dragged and dropped to reorder the sections.

Current status: deprecated, see above.
