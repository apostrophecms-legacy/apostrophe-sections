# apostrophe-sections

## Overview

Support for pages that are split into multiple sections, accessible via scrolling but also via tabs. There is support for adding, removing, reordering and re-titling sections conveniently. Entire sections may be dragged and dropped to reorder the sections.

Current status: working rather nicely, but absolutely no standard styles, and the button markup needs to be made more suitable.
